-check if all imports from data_loading.py and trainers works fine
-create unique abstract function train() which takes arguments from config/dataloaders
    planned structure for now:
            from config import *
          (loaders) = get_loaders()
          optimizer = optimizer
          criterion = criterion
          train(loaders)
-figure out tensorboard*****

13.10.2022
-train deep lab using train() function, evaluate and check results
-research on segmentation metrics
-add metrics for segmentation training(IoU etc...)
-understend deep_lab_v3 achitecture!!!


19.10.2022
-train detector on collab
-create function for segmenter inferencing using sigmoid


20.10.2022
-train detector for 3 classes not 2!
-start working on instance segmentation
-research on keypoint detection network as well as dataset
-write docuemntation/paper on how faster rcnn and deep lab working and imlementing training guide!
